    "This dataset contains information about collisions that occured in Seattle, Washington from January 2004 until May 2020. There are 194673 records of collisions before cleaning the data. This should be sufficient to do a number of different types of analysis. Each data point pertains to a differnt collision over a broad range of different types of collisions. They range from head on collisions to hitting a parked car to backing into a fixed object. It also includes other data about the collisions including location of accidents, weather conditions, and time of day. We will go more detail about individual variables in the Variables subsection below. "
